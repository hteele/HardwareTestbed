# NOS-T Hardware Testbed

This is a work-in-progress repository for the hardware implementation for the New Observing Strategies Testbed (NOS-T).

Information about NOS-T can be found [here](https://nost-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or through the project's [Git repository](https://github.com/code-lab-org/nost-tools)

## Roadmap

The hardware aspect of NOS-T aims to incorporate the existing digital environment and incorporate various test cases along with physical sensors to determine the general effectiveness and merit of the simulation. The hardware testbed aims to follow the following structure:
